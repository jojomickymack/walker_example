# Walker Example

This is an example I made for myself as I attempted to make a simple parallaxing effect as you move your character left or 
right across a tilemap. It also has dialogs that you see when colliding with different regions on the map.

After you pass the frog, there's nothing else to see, you'll end up walking right forever - however, you can walk left again 
and redo the dialogs by colliding with the characters again.
